<p id="description">This repository contains the VHDL implementation of a FIR (Finite Impulse Response) filter with N=7. The FIR filter is used to process digital signals. It is a non-recursive digital filter whose behavior is defined by a finite sequence of coefficients known as the impulse response.

The implemented filter in this project is designed for a specific sampling frequency. The normalized cutoff frequency is set to 0.2 relative to the sampling frequency, determining the filter's transition band.

FIR filters are widely used in digital signal processing for various applications, such as audio and image processing, communications, and control systems. They offer flexibility, stability, and precise control over the frequency response, making them a valuable tool in many signal processing tasks. See the <a href="https://github.com/mirawara/FIR-Filter/wiki/Filter-Wiki">Wiki</a> for further details and for the description of the filter.</p>

<h2>ðŸ˜‰ Tips: </h2>

1. Use Modelsim to test the circuit.
2. Use Vivado for RTL and Synthesis.
